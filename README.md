# React Calculator

This is a calculator I built using react. Currently upports +, -, *, /, and %.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### `npm test`

Launches test runner in the interactive watch mode

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes
